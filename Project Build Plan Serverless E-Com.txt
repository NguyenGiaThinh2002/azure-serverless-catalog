**Project Build Plan: Serverless E-Commerce Catalog (.NET 8 + React 18 + Supabase)**

This plan is divided into prompt stages you can copy-paste directly into an AI tool (like Grok, Claude, or ChatGPT) to generate detailed step-by-step instructions for each part. Each stage builds on the previous one, taking you from zero to a fully deployed, production-grade app in 4–6 weeks.
Use this format for each AI prompt: "Act as a senior .NET + React + Supabase architect. Give me a detailed, step-by-step guide for [STAGE DESCRIPTION]. Assume I have Visual Studio Code, .NET 8 SDK, Node 18+, a Supabase free account, and GitHub. Include exact commands, code snippets, and best practices for security and performance.
